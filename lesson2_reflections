Q1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new folder .git is created that stores meta-data required to create a Git Repository. However, no commit is created as Git believes in manual commits rather than auto-commits.

Q2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A staging area is essentially a "holding area" for changes to be committed the next time "git commit" is called.
It allows us to divide large changes in to small logical commits. We can only send files relevant to a given logical change into the staging area.
Staging area also helps us review the change we are planning to commit. This is because we have not yet committed the changes.
